# RoachPopulation

Implement a class RoachPopulation that simulates the growth of a roach population. The constructor takes the size of the initial roach population. The breed method simulates a period in which the roaches breed, which doubles their population. The spray method method simulates spraying with pesticide, which reduces the population by 10%. The getRoaches method returns the current number of roaches. Write a tester program, RoachSimulation simulates a population that starts out with 100 roaches. Breed, spray, and print roach count. Repeat three more times.
