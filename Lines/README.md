# Lines

A line in the plane can be specified in various ways:

(1) by giving a point (x,y) and a slope m.
(2) by giving two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
(3) as an equation in slope-intercept form y = mx + b.
(4) as an equation x = a if the line is vertical.

Implement a class Lines that allows the user to choose any of the four ways to input two lines.
The class then determines if the lines (1) intersect, (2) equals, or (3) parallel to each other.
