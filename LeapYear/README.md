# LeapYear

First APCS assignment of the year.

A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 (1980), except that it is not a leap year if it is divisible by 100 (1900); however, it is a leap year if it is divisible by 400. There were no exceptions before the introduction of the Gregorian calendar on October 15, 1582 (for example, 1500 was a leap year). Write a program with a given year, determine if that year is a leap year or not.
