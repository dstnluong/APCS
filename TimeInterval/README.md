# TimeInterval
Write a program that reads two times in military format (0900, 1730) and prints the number of hours and minutes between the two times. Here is a sample run. User input is in color.

Please enter the first time: 0900
Please enter the second time: 1730
8 hours and 30 minutes

 You must deal with the case where the first time is later than the second time.

Please enter the first time: 1730
Please enter the second time: 0900
15 hours and 30 minutes
